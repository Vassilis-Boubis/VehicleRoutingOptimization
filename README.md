# Vehicle Routing Optimization
This Python script solves the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by optimizing delivery routes for a fleet of six trucks while maximizing profit. It processes customer data, including locations, demands, service times, and profits, and assigns deliveries while adhering to time and capacity constraints. The script refines routes using optimization techniques such as relocation moves, swap moves, and 2-opt moves to minimize travel distance and improve efficiency. Iterative improvements ensure the most profitable configuration is selected, and the final solution is saved to a CSV file for validation. This approach is widely applicable in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management, helping to enhance delivery efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
